# tag-based-file-storage

The aim of this project is to propose a file storage in which the files can be found on the basis of their content which is achieved by generating relevant and automatic tags (words as well as phrases) for files thus ceasing the need to remember the exact name of the files when searching a files in large number of files. The RAKE algorithm has been used for text mining. The book Text Mining Applications and theory was referred for understanding the concepts. The code has been implemented in python. One implementation is based on implementation based on reading, while in the other a python library is used.

Simply run the main.py.
